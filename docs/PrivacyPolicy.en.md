title: Privacy Policy
description: WindowTranslator Privacy Policy
---

This Privacy Policy governs the use of "WindowTranslator" (hereinafter referred to as "the Application").

## Introduction
The Application is open source and available on GitHub ( https://github.com/Freeesia/WindowTranslator ).  
The Application generally does not collect personal information or usage data from its users. However, when users explicitly choose to send error reports, minimal information necessary for technical problem resolution is collected.

## Collection of Personal Information

### Information Collected by the Application  
The Application does not directly collect personal data such as user input, interaction history, or device information during normal use.
However, when users explicitly choose to send error reports, necessary information for technical problem resolution is collected.

### Error Logs and Crash Reports  
The Application collects the following information only when users explicitly perform error report submission:

- Application operation information
- PC hardware specification information
- OS environment information
- Error occurrence circumstances

This information is used solely for technical problem resolution and application quality improvement, and does not include personally identifiable information.
Error report submission is completely voluntary and will never be sent automatically without user consent.

## Handling of Google User Data  
When accessing Google Apps Script services, the Application obtains only the minimum required authentication tokens.  
No personal information of the user is used beyond this authentication.

### Use of Collected Data  
The obtained authentication information is used solely to execute Google Apps Script within the Application.  
This authentication is strictly limited to the purpose of enabling the use of Google services.

### Sharing or Transfer of Data  
The Application provider does not collect, store, share, or transfer any authentication information or other Google user data.  
All authentication data is stored on the user’s PC and used solely for accessing Google services.

### Data Protection  
Authentication data is securely stored on the user’s PC, and the Application provider does not have any access rights to this data.  
Additional security measures depend on the user’s own PC security management.

### Data Retention and Deletion  
Authentication tokens are stored only on the user’s PC.  
Deletion of these tokens is completed by the user removing the folder located at `%APPDATA%\StudioFreesia\WindowTranslator\GoogleAppsScriptPlugin`.

## Use of Translation Engines and Third-Party Libraries  
The Application is designed to support multiple translation engines, including Google Translate and DeepL.  
These translation engines and associated libraries may collect user data or usage information in accordance with their respective privacy policies.  
Users are strongly advised to review the privacy policies of the translation services they use.
